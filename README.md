# Ally Bank Coding Challenge


Hello there! My name is Jose Viscasillas

This is my Ally Bank Coding Challenge Page.

I used grunt-cli, grunt-contrib-watch, and grunt-contrib-sass to compile my sass to css.
Oh and i threw in some flex to create a responsive design


## Keep working!

**Run**

```
	npm install
```
To install my dependencies

**then Run**

```
	grunt watch
```
To run grunt tasks (bundle+concat all js, and css-down that sass file)
